#### Git Branch Management: Deleting or Renaming Misspelled Branches

```bash
1. Deleting a Misspelled Branch Locally.
# Delete the branch locally (if it has been merged)
git branch -d <misspelled-branch-name>

# If the branch has not been merged, force delete it:
git branch -D <misspelled-branch-name>

2. Deleting a Misspelled Branch Remotely
If the misspelled branch has been pushed to GitHub or another remote repository,
you can delete it remotely with this command:
git push origin --delete <misspelled-branch-name>

3. Verifying Branch Deletion
To check if the branch was deleted successfully:

# Check locally
git branch

# Check remotely
git branch -r

4. Renaming a Misspelled Branch
If you just misspelled the branch name and would prefer to rename it instead of deleting it, follow these steps:

# Rename the branch locally
git branch -m <old-branch-name> <new-branch-name>

# Push the renamed branch to the remote repository
git push origin <new-branch-name>

# Delete the old branch remotely
git push origin --delete <old-branch-name>

Conclusion
This guide provides all the necessary commands to handle misspelled Git branches.
 You can either delete or rename branches locally and remotely based on your situation.
These steps will help you maintain clean and organized branch names in your Git repository.
